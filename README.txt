Fun with libjpeg-9b. 
Put compiler options and the paths to libjpeg-9b in the param.inc file

Requires libjpeg-9b

If using minGW, libjpeg-9.dll must be someplace where Windows will find it.

Implemented so far

jpfun1/create: creates 2 jpeg files
jpfun1/compare: compares 2 jpeg files and gives a grayscale jpeg as a result
